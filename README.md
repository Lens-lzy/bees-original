Bees Algorithm

This tutorial is about a basic form of Bees Algorithm.
The Bees Algorithm is a population-based nature-inspired search algorithm, that mimics the food foraging behaviour of swarms of honey bees. 
It performs a kind of neighbourhood search combined with random search, and it can be used for both combinatorial optimization and functional optimization.
